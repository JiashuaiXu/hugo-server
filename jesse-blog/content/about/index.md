# About This Blog

Welcome to Jesse's Blog! This is a personal space where I share my thoughts, experiences, and learnings.

## Using Obsidian with Hugo

This blog is powered by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) with the [PaperMod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod) theme. I write my content using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), a powerful knowledge management tool, and then publish it to this Hugo site.
